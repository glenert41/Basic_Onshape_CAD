# Basic_Onshape_CAD
Basic CAD but it is fun because Onshape exists. 




 ## Caster
 
 ### Base

The is the Base of the Caster. This is from module 1.
Here is the Onshape File:

I am starting to pick up Onshape again. It seems sleeker than Soldiworks, so I'm pretty excited to keep working on it.



### Mount

 This is the Mount. This is from module 2.
 Here is the Onshape File:

As mentioned in the module video, you are able to make the exact same part in different ways. For me, I like extruding the large square first, then going in and cutting the large circle in an extrude, then in another extrude, add the four smaller holes. I feel that this is the easiest way to do it, as it allows for changes to be made easier along the way.
 
### Fork

This is the Fork. This is from module 3.
Here is the Onshape File:

This is my favorite part that we have made so far, as I think the fillets and chamfers make the part look really good. I really appreciate how Onshape lets you have multiple part studios operating at once; it makes creating parts and assembling them much easier. Regarding the Fork itself, it was really cool to see how easy it was to mirror the features, as well as using tangent propogation to help auto-select features.


### Tire

This is the Tire. This is from Module 4.
Here is the Onshape FIle:

This was the first part that involved the revole feature. It is still cool to me to see us turn a trapezoid in to a circle. From this lesson, I learned how to change the color of a part (by right clicking the part in the bottom left, then clicking edit appearance), which is super valuable later down the road, especially in assemblies.


### Wheel

This the the Wheel. This is from Module 5. 
Here is the Onshape File:

[Wheel](https://cvilleschools.onshape.com/documents/3e800529a5d53c6bf3b12ad7/w/8dffd314e94bea2202dd8631/e/bac46bb1e6f9f600915a40fc)


This part was a pretty fun one to design I thought. I really liked learning that you could change your view; to show or hide hidden edges. Also, it was cool to learn that selecting a face and trying to fillet that face, results in all edges of the face to recieve a fillet. Small stuff like that really helps boost my confidence as well as ability with Onshape.


### Axle, Collar, Bearings

<img src="Images/Screenshot%202020-09-22%20at%204.23.06%20PM.png" width="256">


This is the Axle, Collar, and Bearing. This is from modules 6-9.
Here are the Onshape Files:

[Axle](https://cvilleschools.onshape.com/documents/3e800529a5d53c6bf3b12ad7/w/8dffd314e94bea2202dd8631/e/c9bab325a182d33864d236fd)

[Collar](https://cvilleschools.onshape.com/documents/3e800529a5d53c6bf3b12ad7/w/8dffd314e94bea2202dd8631/e/c9bab325a182d33864d236fd)

[Bearing](https://cvilleschools.onshape.com/documents/3e800529a5d53c6bf3b12ad7/w/8dffd314e94bea2202dd8631/e/3b6220d5c55b2dc0cd341610)


These parts were pretty easy to design, especially after the Wheel. I feel like making the Big Bearing part was very straightforward, which I guess is a good sign. For the Axle and Collar part, it was helpful to use the Use/Project/Convert feature, which allows you to reference lines, vertexes, and edges that you have already made. 


### Sub-Assembly


<img src="Images/Screenshot%202020-09-23%20at%201.11.45%20PM.png" width="256">

This is the Sub-Assembly. This is from the Sub-Assembly Module. 
Here is Onshape File:

[Sub-Assembly](https://cvilleschools.onshape.com/documents/3e800529a5d53c6bf3b12ad7/w/8dffd314e94bea2202dd8631/e/adcc3e69b175d6d06010687c)


This was the first time I have used Mates in Onshape. It honeslty was harder than I expected, compared to Solidworks. I was not used to the mate selector on OnShape, and at the moment, I still prefer the Solidworks way of mating. That being said, the Onshape mate selector feature definitely seems like a more streamlined way to mate parts.
