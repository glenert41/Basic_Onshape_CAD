# Basic_Onshape_CAD
Basic CAD but it is fun because Onshape exists.

I am starting to pick up Onshape again. It seems sleeker than Soldiworks, so I'm pretty excited to keep working on it.

As mentioned in the module video, you are able to make the exact same part in different ways. For me, I like extruding the large square first, then going in and cutting the large circle in an extrude, then in another extrude, add the four smaller holes. I feel that this is the easiest way to do it, as it allows for changes to be made easier along the way.
