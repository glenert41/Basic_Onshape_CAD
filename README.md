# Basic_Onshape_CAD
Basic CAD but it is fun because Onshape exists. 




 ## Caster
 
 ### Base

<img src="Images/Screenshot%202020-09-17%20at%209.12.58%20PM.png" width="256">
The is the Base of the Caster. This is from module 1.
Here is the Onshape File:

I am starting to pick up Onshape again. It seems sleeker than Soldiworks, so I'm pretty excited to keep working on it.



### Mount

 This is the Mount. This is from module 2.
 Here is the Onshape File:

As mentioned in the module video, you are able to make the exact same part in different ways. For me, I like extruding the large square first, then going in and cutting the large circle in an extrude, then in another extrude, add the four smaller holes. I feel that this is the easiest way to do it, as it allows for changes to be made easier along the way.
 
### Fork
<img src="Images/Screenshot%202020-09-20%20at%205.29.24%20PM.png" width="256">

This is the Fork. This is from module 3.
Here is the Onshape File:

This is my favorite part that we have made so far, as I think the fillets and chamfers make the part look really good. I really appreciate how Onshape lets you have multiple part studios operating at once; it makes creating parts and assembling them much easier. Regarding the Fork itself, it was really cool to see how easy it was to mirror the features, as well as using tangent propogation to help auto-select features.


### Tire

This is the Tire. This is from Module 4.
Here is the Onshape FIle:

[Tire](https://cvilleschools.onshape.com/documents/3e800529a5d53c6bf3b12ad7/w/8dffd314e94bea2202dd8631/e/8374551becc496810e5f66a0)

This was the first part that involved the revole feature. It is still cool to me to see us turn a trapezoid in to a circle. From this lesson, I learned how to change the color of a part (by right clicking the part in the bottom left, then clicking edit appearance), which is super valuable later down the road, especially in assemblies.


### Wheel


<img src="Images/Screenshot%202020-09-21%20at%209.47.58%20PM.png" width="256">
                                       


This the the Wheel. This is from Module 5. 
Here is the Onshape File:

[Wheel](https://cvilleschools.onshape.com/documents/3e800529a5d53c6bf3b12ad7/w/8dffd314e94bea2202dd8631/e/bac46bb1e6f9f600915a40fc)


This part was a pretty fun one to design I thought. I really liked learning that you could change your view; to show or hide hidden edges. Also, it was cool to learn that selecting a face and trying to fillet that face, results in all edges of the face to recieve a fillet. Small stuff like that really helps boost my confidence as well as ability with Onshape.


### Axle, Collar, Bearings

<img src="Images/Screenshot%202020-09-22%20at%204.23.06%20PM.png" width="256">


This is the Axle, Collar, and Bearing. This is from modules 6-9.
Here are the Onshape Files:

[Axle](https://cvilleschools.onshape.com/documents/3e800529a5d53c6bf3b12ad7/w/8dffd314e94bea2202dd8631/e/c9bab325a182d33864d236fd)

[Collar](https://cvilleschools.onshape.com/documents/3e800529a5d53c6bf3b12ad7/w/8dffd314e94bea2202dd8631/e/c9bab325a182d33864d236fd)

[Bearing](https://cvilleschools.onshape.com/documents/3e800529a5d53c6bf3b12ad7/w/8dffd314e94bea2202dd8631/e/3b6220d5c55b2dc0cd341610)


These parts were pretty easy to design, especially after the Wheel. I feel like making the Big Bearing part was very straightforward, which I guess is a good sign. For the Axle and Collar part, it was helpful to use the Use/Project/Convert feature, which allows you to reference lines, vertexes, and edges that you have already made. 


### Sub-Assembly


<img src="Images/Screenshot%202020-09-23%20at%201.11.45%20PM.png" width="256">

This is the Sub-Assembly. This is from the Sub-Assembly Module. 
Here is Onshape File:

[Sub-Assembly](https://cvilleschools.onshape.com/documents/3e800529a5d53c6bf3b12ad7/w/8dffd314e94bea2202dd8631/e/adcc3e69b175d6d06010687c)


This was the first time I have used Mates in Onshape. It honeslty was harder than I expected, compared to Solidworks. I was not used to the mate selector on OnShape, and at the moment, I still prefer the Solidworks way of mating. That being said, the Onshape mate selector feature definitely seems like a more streamlined way to mate parts.



### Final Assembly

This is the Final Assembly. This is from the Final Caster Assembly Modules.
Here is the Onshape File:

[Final Assembly](https://cvilleschools.onshape.com/documents/3e800529a5d53c6bf3b12ad7/w/8dffd314e94bea2202dd8631/e/caebe5dfda4664341990c2fc)

This was the final part of the Caster Assignment Base Assembly (The 10 Modules). This was pretty straightforward, and I am starting to feel a little more comfortable with Onshape's mating approach. I think the biggest take away for me was the Solve feature, especially in the Revolute mate. It was cool to see that all you had to do was click 2 of the mate connectors, click solve, and then your mate would be fully defined. Also, it was really helpful to be able to get the Screws, Nuts, and Pins without having to go through the long process of folders from the Solidworks Toolbox; Onshape is definitely more efficient and is more intuitive to me now.




## Picture Frame (Dowel Pins)

### Picture Frame

<img src="Images/Screenshot%202020-10-02%20at%2011.06.33%20AM.png" width="256">

This is the Picture Frame. This is from the Dorothy's Dowel Pins module.
Here is the Onshape FIle:

[Picture Frame](https://cvilleschools.onshape.com/documents/810195daa95fac4bfaed5f45/w/36091a1139bfeb7e6a005093/e/9079518065174b397b234f74)

This is the Picture Frame; Made from 2 long trapezoids, 2 short trapezoids, 4 short Dowel Pins, and 4 Long Dowel Pins. Between the connection of each Trapezoid, there are 2 Dowel pins in order to increase the strength of the connection. In order to see the Dowel Pins, you must made Hidden Edges Visible from the Camera and Render Options dropdown on the right hand side of the screen.

Moving on to the process itself, the biggest new thing we learned was how to use Configurations in Onshape. In Solidworks, configurations were honestly too difficult for me to use often, unless I had preplanned to use configurations and planned by whole assembly based off the configurations. However, in Onshape, using configurations is very simple. I think one of the things that make it so easy is the customization and simplicity of it. Especially in assemblies, being able to insert a very specific configuartion by just going through a checklist is super easy to use.


## Onshape Challenge

### Spinner

This is the Spinner. This is from the Onshape Challenge Module:
Here is the Onshape file:

This module took quite a bit of patience; more than all the others did. I think the toughest part was trying to figure out how to mate the pieces together. This took plenty of research online and collaboration with friends to find when to use which mate when. Cylindrical mates definitely helped out the most, allowing for the stem of the fork to rotate and move while staying within its cylinder. I feel more comfortable with the Onshape mating system now. Also, making the sketch a the Onshape equivalent of a Thin Feature was pretty straightforward after I understood how to do it (Just extruding the surface and then thickening the surface). That all being said, I really enjoyed working on this module.
